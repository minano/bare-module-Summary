HOW TO PREPARE SENSOR DATA (IV) TO BE UPLOADED TO DATA BASE:

0. It requires Root installed
1. Run the bash script "sensor-config.sh"

Example:
./sensor-config.sh 322497 44 4 CUT

The arguments needed are:
batch number: 6 digits
wafer number: 2 digits
sensor number: 1 digit
step: CIS, NEW, CUT, BAM...

2. The script asks for a temperature during the IV scan. 
Add it, manually in Celsius degrees.

echo "Type temperature: "
read temperature


3. The two files required to upload to the database are generated and the tar file is created.

SensorTest_S322497-44-4_CUT.inf.txt --> There is a space for comments. If you want to add something, you can do it manually.
SensorTest_S322497-44-4_CUT.tab.txt

4. It is recommended to check the txt files during the first times using this script.

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES:

1. The script creates a folder (example:"SensorTest_S322497-44-4_CUT")
where all the information is saved.
First, the script copies the ivCurve.log to this folder from a folder called B322497-44-4 in the example.
IMPORTANT: Confirm that the path to take ivCurve.log fits to you.

2. A root macro is launched to manage data, calculate parameters as slope and normalized current and grade the sensor.
IMPORTANT: Do not separate sensor-config.sh from BMT_sensor.C
